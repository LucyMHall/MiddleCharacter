## Requirements
The program runs in a repl like IRB or in the browser console

It's fine to use Ruby or JavaScript.

Your job is to return the middle character of a word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.

## Acceptance Criteria
get_middle("test") # => "es"
get_middle("testing") # => "t"
get_middle("middle") # => "dd"
get_middle("A") # => "A"
get_middle("of") # => "of"

## Initial Thoughts
- accepts a string
- reads the length of the string
- selects a position in that string
- returns a character
